### Tiles 3: Basemap with Vaccination Sites

### Tiles 4: LGBTQ Theme
On this map, I choose to color the main components of the map with colors of the LGBTQ flag. I tried to use colors that are closed to shades commonly uses for these features, and surprizing the outcome looks festive, but it reminds me more of LEGOs.
