# LAB4 Tiles

For this assignment, I limited the scpoe to the Seattle Area, because I think it is more relevant to me as live in this area. I choose to only export tiles with Zoom 10 to 14, because as demonstated in the forth tiles, the smaller zoom covers a much wider area that I am not focusing on. And although it doesn't take much storage space, it is not benefitial to our understanding of the area. 

### Tile 1: [Basemap](https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/kristinahsu/cl2v50rho000t15n5qbtynvum.html?title=view&access_token=pk.eyJ1Ijoia3Jpc3RpbmFoc3UiLCJhIjoiY2wydjQycGVoMDhjejNqcGUya2NsYXZ2ZSJ9.RQhWFhzMfnuPxcS-Avqtsw&zoomwheel=true&fresh=true#11.53/47.6676/-122.3325)
For the basemap, I choose to color some features including parks hospital, and schools. Also, I changed the font to Open Sans.

### Tile 2: Vacination Sites
For this layer, I decided to plot the vacination sites data. The data is obtained from the [CDC](https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/Vaccines-gov-COVID-19-vaccinating-provider-locatio/5jp2-pgaw/data) and it locates all registered vaccination sites in the United States.

### Tile 4: [LGBTQ Theme](https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/kristinahsu/cl2vdagvb002g14mxfd3oek2h.html?title=view&access_token=pk.eyJ1Ijoia3Jpc3RpbmFoc3UiLCJhIjoiY2wydjQycGVoMDhjejNqcGUya2NsYXZ2ZSJ9.RQhWFhzMfnuPxcS-Avqtsw&zoomwheel=true&fresh=true#12.93/47.66519/-122.3243)
On this map, I choose to color the main components of the map with colors of the LGBTQ flag. I tried to use colors that are closed to shades commonly uses for these features, and surprizing the outcome looks festive, but it reminds me more of LEGOs.

- Pride (Rainbow) Flag Color Codes with HEX, RGB, CYMK & Pantone
    - Red: #D12229. = Hospital
    - Orange: #F68A1E. = 
    - Yellow: #FDE01A.
    - Green: #007940.
    - Indigo: #24408E.
    - Violet: #732982.
