# LAB4 Tiles

For this assignment, I limited the scpoe to the Seattle Area, because I think it is more relevant to me as live in this area. I choose to only export tiles with Zoom 10 to 14, because as demonstated in the forth tiles, the smaller zoom covers a much wider area that I am not focusing on. And although it doesn't take much storage space, it is not benefitial to our understanding of the area. 

### Tiles 1: Basemap
For the basemap, I choose to color some features including parks hospital, and schools. Also, I changed the font to Open Sans.

### Tiles 2: Vacination Sites
For this layer, I decided to plot the vacination sites data. The data is obtained from the CDC

### Tiles 4: LGBTQ Theme
On this map, I choose to color the main components of the map with colors of the LGBTQ flag. I tried to use colors that are closed to shades commonly uses for these features, and surprizing the outcome looks festive, but it reminds me more of LEGOs.
