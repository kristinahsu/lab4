# LAB4 Tiles

For this assignment, I limited the scope to the Seattle Area, because I think it is more relevant to me as I live in this area. I choose to only export tiles with Zoom 10 to 14 because as demonstrated in the fourth tiles, the smaller zoom covers a much wider area that I am not focusing on. Although it doesn't take much storage space, it is not beneficial to our understanding of the area and looks rather messy.

### Tile 1: [Basemap](https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/kristinahsu/cl2v50rho000t15n5qbtynvum.html?title=view&access_token=pk.eyJ1Ijoia3Jpc3RpbmFoc3UiLCJhIjoiY2wydjQycGVoMDhjejNqcGUya2NsYXZ2ZSJ9.RQhWFhzMfnuPxcS-Avqtsw&zoomwheel=true&fresh=true#11.53/47.6676/-122.3325)
For the base map, I choose to color some features including parks hospitals, and schools. Also, I changed the font to Open Sans. This base map that I created is similar to the street map design and is personally my favorite as it is simple, yet has some color-coding that differentiates some geographic/spatial features. In addtion, icons are also inclluded for places as UW and Woodland Park zoo.

### Tile 2: Vacination Sites
For this layer, I decided to plot the vaccination sites data. The data is obtained from the [CDC](https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/Vaccines-gov-COVID-19-vaccinating-provider-locatio/5jp2-pgaw/data) and it locates all registered vaccination sites in the United States.

### Tile 3: Basemap with Vaccination Sites

In this map, we incorporate both information from the first two tiles.

### Tile 4: [LGBTQ Theme](https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/kristinahsu/cl2vdagvb002g14mxfd3oek2h.html?title=view&access_token=pk.eyJ1Ijoia3Jpc3RpbmFoc3UiLCJhIjoiY2wydjQycGVoMDhjejNqcGUya2NsYXZ2ZSJ9.RQhWFhzMfnuPxcS-Avqtsw&zoomwheel=true&fresh=true#12.93/47.66519/-122.3243)
On this map, I choose to color the main components of the map with the colors of the LGBTQ flag. I tried to use colors that are closed to shades commonly uses for these features, and surprizing the outcome looks festive, but it reminds me more of LEGOs.
